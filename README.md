# Ta gengo 多言語
What if your keyboard pronounce the letter as soon as you press it wouldn't it make learning a new language more easier?
With this concept I created a website on which on clicking letters you can check their pronunciation.
Added with a chatbot which will chat with you in the same language same as talking to a person.
It also has a cool game so make your score the next High Score!!!!!

Currently available for English, japanese and german will add more languages soon.
